## Quick Start Guide

### Required Software

Download the following:

* Fldigi
* HRRM v1.0.4 binary or HRRM_setup windows installer: github.com/gh42lb/HRRM

run the windows installer or create a folder on the desktop called HRRM

### Configuration

Fldigi XmlRpc: HRRM requires fldigi XmlRpc. This is usually configured by default in fldigi. If you are having issues connecting, check Fldigi XmlRpc external api is enabled and the ip and port are set to 127.0.0.1 and 7362 respectively. If you wish to use a different fldigi xmlrpc port or ip this can be specified using the fldigi=<IP>:<port> command line optionin HRRM as follows:   .\hrrm.exe fldigi=127.0.0.1:7362

Fldigi Soundcard: In fldigi, Configure / Soundcard / Devices. Check the sound card device settings in fldigi and ensure they are set correctly for your soundcard / radio

Fldigi RsID: In fldigi, Configure / IDs / RsID. Uncheck 'Retain tx freq lock'. Check 'Searches passband'

Fldigi Operator: in fldigi, Configure / Misc / Operator Station. Set 'Station Callsign' and 'Operator Callsign'

HRRM Callsign: In HRRM, 'MyInfo' tab / Callsign. Enter your callsign

HRRM Group Name: In HRRM, 'MyInfo' tab / Group Name. Enter the chosen group name (must have a preceeding @ character) that you will be communicating with. You can leave this at the default '@HRRM'

HRRM Grid Square: in HRRM, 'MyInfo' tab / Grid Square. Enter you grid square into the field.


### Running the Application

start fldigi first

Now start hrrm by running the exe\binary from the command line or double clicking on the icon on the desktop

if everything is installed correctly, hrrm will connect to fldigi and display the main window.



### Calling CQ

Click the 'CQ CQ' button to call CQ.

A station that hears the CQ can click 'Copy' to reply back.

the 'Connect To:' field is the callsign of the station you are connecting to. If blank, enter the callsign for the station you wish to connect to.

The receiving station should also enter your callsign into the same field on their application if it is blank.

Click the chat tab and type some text and hit send.




enjoy :)
